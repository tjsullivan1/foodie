# foodie

An application to manage my recipes. Currently being built to export from Paprika, convert to JSON, store in Cosmos DB and then present through a Flask Frontend.

## Vision

This app will allow for a cook to create and manage recipes and their pantry. Based off ingredients in the pantry, we can suggest what you should cook. In addition, we can learn your preferences and recommend things along those lines from your recipe list. Finally, we can suggest recipes that will challenge your cooking abilities.
